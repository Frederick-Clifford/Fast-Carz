        description: "These days even legacy luxury automakers like Bentley need an SUV in their stable, and the 2024 Bentayga doesn't skimp on the ultimate posh experience that the brand's Continental GT and Flying Spur models are known for. Step up into its cabin and the Bentayga's aromatic leather wraps you in a gentle hug. Scan the dash and take in the gorgeous metal trim and rich wood inlays mixed with modern infotainment tech. Press the Bentayga's console-mounted start button and one of two available engines—a velvety V-8, or a silky plug-in hybrid V-6—smoothly comes to life behind the appropriately imperious grille. You're in a Bentley, for sure, even if it takes the less alluring shape of an SUV. Performance is admirable with any of the powertrains, but the V-8 proved quickest in our testing, hitting 60 mph in a scant 3.5 seconds. But performance may not matter if you plan to be chauffeured, and if that's the case, the extended wheelbase Bentayga is the one you should opt for—and make sure to order the reclining rear seats for maximum relaxation.",

        description: "The Bentayga gets a new range-topping Mulliner trim for 2024 that comes with unique exterior design elements and can be specified in almost 4000 different interior color combinations. Bentley says it's also used more sustainable materials inside the Mulliner than other Bentleys, including carpets made from wool or recycled nylon, and leather tanned using a byproduct of olive oil. The Mulliner can be had only with the Bentayga's extended-wheelbase body and the V-8 engine. The rest of the Bentayga lineup receives some subtle styling changes, namely the grille and wheels. The S and Azure models receive a rear-wheel steering system. A pair of cushy bucket seats for the second row are now available too. The W-12 engine is no longer an option for the Bentayga as the brand phases it out in favor of more fuel-efficient offerings such as hybrids and EVs.",

        {title: "Pricing and Which One to Buy",
        description: "The price of the 2024 Bentley Bentayga starts at $205,925 and goes up to $339,150 depending on the trim and options. We like the V-8 model best. We'd suggest picking the eight-cylinder model over the hybrid V-6 and adding some niceties to it, such as the adaptive suspension, the rear-seat entertainment system, and the 20-speaker Naim stereo. And choosing the Touring Specification package will give you a suite of driver-assistance features. If you're looking to maximize luxury for your rear-seat passengers, go with the extended-wheelbase model, which provides additional legroom and more rear-seat amenities.",

        {title: "Engine, Transmission, and Performance",
        description: "Bentley offers a variety of powertrains for the Bentayga. On the low end, you have a 443-hp hybrid arrangement with a turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 and an electric motor; Azure and S hybrids offer a slightly more powerful 455-hp version of the electrified powertrain. During testing, the Azure Hybrid reached 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, so not as quickly as the big-power twin-turbo V-8. Then there's the 542-hp twin-turbo V-8 engine. The V-8 emits a hearty burble on its way to 60 mph, which it does in just 3.5 seconds. Sadly, Bentley's W-12 engine is no longer offered in the Bentayga. Regardless of what's under the hood, all Bentaygas utilize an eight-speed automatic transmission and come standard with all-wheel drive. We also tested a 2023 Bentley Bentayga S as part of a 0-to-150-to-0 speed test where it returned to a stop in just 32.8 seconds.",

The hybrid is rated for 20 mpg combined and can drive for 23 miles on electricity alone. On our 75-mph highway fuel economy route, the V-8-powered Bentayga managed to outperform its EPA-rating with a 24-mpg result.

Bentley allows buyers to customize just about everything. Buyers can opt for front and rear buckets, seating four, or they can select a three-across second-row bench. While the rear seat doesn't feel as lavish as that of the Bentayga's key rival—the Rolls-Royce Cullinan—it still offers plenty of space for adult passengers to stretch out in. The new long-wheelbase model offers more legroom and additional amenities, so that's the one to buy if you're planning on being chauffeured. It's still a two-row vehicle, and it can be ordered with rear bucket seats that massage and recline up to 40 degrees. Two different mother-of-pearl-faced Breitling dash clocks are available as is a bottle cooler for rear-seat passengers, adjustable ambient interior lighting, and even a safe with a biometric lock and fingerprint reader. The Bentayga's cargo area is generous, at least in two-row versions; we were able to fit nine carry-on suitcases back there.",

With it, rear-seat passengers can browse the web, interact with the Bentayga's infotainment system, or play movies.

This $3 million work of art is capable of pummeling the pavement at over 200 mph thanks to a 16-cylinder engine that features four turbochargers and cranks out at least 1500 horsepower—the more expensive Super Sport model is even more powerful. The Chiron's cabin is just as artfully designed as its exterior, and it coddles occupants in fine materials that help justify its price tag. But let's be honest, people are really paying for the performance here. Those looking for modern conveniences (think Apple CarPlay) or driver-assistance tech, they won't find them here, but after driving this monster, they likely won't care about such minor drawbacks.",

People who choose cars such as the Chiron do so because they want a vehicle that makes a jaw-dropping impact on the boulevard or at the valet stand—or in front of the Monte Carlo Casino. With its swooping lines and famously stratospheric price, the base Chiron certainly fits the bill. We think this model has what it takes to put a smile on the face of even the most discerning hypercar buyer.

Bugatti claims that the Chiron makes the dash from zero to 60 mph in a mere 2.3 seconds, and it has a top speed of 261 mph. If the Chiron's standard engine doesn't quench your thirst for speed, step up to the Chiron Super Sport. This model is equipped with a slightly more potent version of the base powerplant, and it produces 1578 horsepower. At our test track, the Super Sport got to 60 mph in just 2.2 seconds and, amazingly, hit 200 mph in under 15 seconds. Piloted by factory test driver Andy Wallace, a model with specs almost identical to those of the Chiron Super Sport logged a record-setting 304.773 mph test-track run. With every model in the Chiron lineup, power is sent to all four wheels by a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.",

The Pur Sport and Super Sport models are rated for 8 mpg city and 11 highway.

When it comes to performance, the 488 provides the power and poise you'd expect from a car crafted by the legendary Ferrari nameplate.

The Pista coupe comes with 20-inch wheels and the exterior is embellished with a jaunty racing stripe. A standard wing spoiler and sill extensions telegraph the car's performance capabilities. Automatic projector-beam LED headlights illuminate the path ahead, and they come with an auto-leveling feature. The list of standard exterior amenities also includes heated, power-folding side-view mirrors; LED taillights; rear fog lamps; and rain-sensing windshield wipers.

Although we haven't driven the Ultimae version, we have driven the brutally powerful, track-focused SVJ (which stands for Superveloce Jota) and its roofless counterpart and experienced their tremendous acceleration and kidney-crushing cornering forces. The hefty machines heaved through the corners, but their incredible grip and four-wheel-steering systems helped them change direction on a dime. We have also driven the Aventador S and Aventador S roadster and found the latter's top-down ability makes it the better car for listening to the V-12's thrilling timbre.",

Like those cars, the Maybach is designed to pamper every occupant, especially those in the rear, who are treated with options such as reclining seats with massage, a beverage cooler, and electrically operated doors. A standard air suspension virtually erases potholes, making it a peaceful place to close a multimillion-dollar deal or sip a glass of champagne on your way to the red carpet.

The V-8 makes 33 more horsepower than the old S560 from 2020, and it packs quite a punch. During our testing, the S580 rocketed to 60 mph in just 4.1 seconds. But that's not the most impressive thing about the Maybach S-class. During our time with the car, we were impressed with the ride quality and the nearly silent cabin—we recorded an extremely low 64 decibels inside the car while cruising at 70 mph. The V-12's power rating is the same as the 2020 S650 model and does not benefit from a 48-volt hybrid system, but we haven't had a chance to test the new one yet.

Its AMG-developed 851-hp twin-turbo V-12 helps achieve at least one of those understated goals. Another is addressed by its Carbo-Titanium core structure, which is as strong as it is feathery. With a claimed dry weight of just 2822 pounds, the Utopia is at least 229 pounds lighter than the last Pagani we tested, the Huayra Roadster. Like the Koenigsegg CC850 and GMA T.50 hypercars, the Utopia comes with the option of a shiftable seven-speed manual gearbox; it can also be ordered with an automated single-clutch transmission. Pagani put leather straps on the body’s front and rear clamshell panels, gave it butterfly opening doors, and set it up with staggered wheel sizes, 21-inch in front and 22-inch in the rear. The Utopia is unquestionably a masterpiece and guaranteed to be incredibly rare: only 99 Utopia coupes will roll out of the Pagani factory in San Cesario sul Panaro in the province of Modena, Italy.",

At least buyers can rectify the latter issue by optioning the two-seat second row with adjustability and massage functions. The exterior is classic Rolls-Royce, but the vehicle's liftgate configuration allowed the brand to fit the cargo area with an optional Viewing Suite consisting of a pair of leather-wrapped seats and a small table that pop out of the floor.
